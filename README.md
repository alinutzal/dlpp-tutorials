# dlpp-tutorials
Tutorials for the Deep Learning in Particle Physics course, spring semester 2022, at the University of Heidelberg.
These tutorials were produced and delivered with the help of PhD students at the university:  Luigi Favaro, Theo Heimel, and Michel Luchmann.

The physics datasets used for these tutorials were slightly too big to put here, so they will be uploaded elsewhere.
